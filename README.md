Youtube videos have become influential to many people around the world. According to a Forbes article, 
“YouTube Stars Influence Millennials More Than Traditional Celebrities”. 
From understanding more about the trending videos on Youtube by region and time, 
we can understand how trends and culture of different regions changed over time. 
This data was exactly what we were looking for – it is user data that has a time series component and a 
geographical component and these features allow us to analyze different groups of users over time.        

## Data    
All the original CSV and JSON files from kaggle are included in the `youtube_new` directory.      
All the CSV files generated by us are included in the `csv_files` directory.      

## Code
`data_cleaning_and_bubble_charts.ipynb` includes codes for data manipulation and generating bubble charts animation.   
`bar_plots_and_word_clouds.ipynb` includes codes for generating bar plots and word clouds.    
`docs/` directory includes all the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML codes for building our website.
